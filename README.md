# DES Final Project
##Final Project for Discrete Event Systems - Demand Forecasting 

This project utilizes a basic FSM to model demand forecasting
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How To Use:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the files included in repo into a single MATLAB folder 
(you do not need to download main.m and main.mlx, they are functionally 
the same file it is just user preference. If both are downloaded only
main.mlx will work)

Run main.m or main.mlx

Plots will be generated summarizing results
